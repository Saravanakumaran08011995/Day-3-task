Difference between Window, Screen, Document?

Window
------
 * Window is the main JavaScript Object Root.
 * It is also denoted as global object in browser.
 * It can be treated as the root of the Document Object Model.
 * We can access it as window.
 * The Window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser.
 * Window Properties are length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents and more.

Document
--------
 * Document Object Model (DOM) is our HTML, aspx, php or other document that will be loaded into the browser.
 * Document will get loaded inside the window object.
 * Properties of Document are title, Url, cookies, etc.
 * If we want to access property for the window it is window.property, if it is document window.document.

Screen
------
 * The Window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display.
 * Screen properties width and height are the full screen.
 * Screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar.
